## WIR Data
Here I'll tidy up the WIR data, and remove accidental ' in coordinates 

## Read in the data 

```{r}
WIR_org <- read_csv(here("data", "Bear_WIR_Data_orginal.csv"))
#the column names are not very clean, lets fix that first
```
```{r}
#code chunk to clean the column names 
WIR_clean <- WIR_org %>% clean_names()

# now all of the columns are in lower snake case, much better :) 
```

```{r}
# Now we want to get rid of the unnecessary ' hanging before all my longitude points 

WIR_clean$longitude <- gsub("'","",as.character(WIR_clean$longitude))

# Cool, now that ' is taken out of our data, and we can start reading this data in Arc to map out the conflict occurance points! 

```
