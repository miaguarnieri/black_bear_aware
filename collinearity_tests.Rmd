#from Jason's code: 
##Correlation/collinearity#
#Quick way to test for collinearity between covariates#
#cor.matrix <- cor(data)
#cor.matrix
#corrplot(cor.matrix)
#cor.matrix <- cor(data, method = c("pearson"))
#cor.matrix
#corrplot(cor.matrix)
#if you want to examine VIFs, you need to build a model first (with all covariates)
